His patrilineal great-great-great-great-grandfather (his father's father's father's father's father's father) had a son whose name was the eponym of the town of Berryville, Arkansas; and whose grandson (Jesse's "great-great-grand uncle") James Henderson Berry was the fourteenth Governor of Arkansas and a United States Senator from Arkansas (1885 to 1907).

One of his great-great-grandfathers (his father's father's mother's father) was Colonel Thomas E. Champion, who commanded the 96th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment in the American Civil War.

His paternal grandfather served in World War Two (359th Infantry Regiment of the 90th Infantry Division), landed on Utah Beach in Normandy on D-Day, fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and earned the Bronze Star twice. His maternal grandfather also served in Europe during that war (627th Field Artillery Battalion, attached firstly to the 16th Armored Division; secondly to the 109th Infantry Regiment of the 28th Infantry Division); he was a mess sergeant and managed the kitchen at a POW camp, established after V-E Day, in the vicinity of Mannheim, Germany.

His father served in the Vietnam War, in the USAVN's 86th Maintenance Battalion.

His mother is an active tennis player, and in 2012 her United States Tennis Association seniors team, representing the Western Arkansas Tennis Association, were runners-up in the national championship tournament. That year, the finals were held in Indian Wells, California.
